abstract:
 - Investigated distinctions in EV cargo composition between AD and control neurons derived from iPSCs.
 - Performed bulk RNA sequencing on EVs isolated from neurons differentiated from AD patients (n=8) and healthy individuals (n=6).  
 - Identified differentially expressed genes and suggested potential biomarkers for AD.
