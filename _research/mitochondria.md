abstract:
 - Identified mitochondria-related DEGs common across six human postmortem and three iN models.
 - Validated key genes in an independent human postmortem dataset using random forest machine learning.
 - Analyzed data from human brain regions and iN models with different genetic backgrounds, revealing shared mitochondrial abnormalities across AD cases.
