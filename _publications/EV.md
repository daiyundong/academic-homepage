  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) profoundly impacts over 55 million individuals globally, with cases projected to triple by 2050, posing an escalating public health challenge. The underlying mechanisms of AD remain incompletely understood, highlighting the urgent need for reliable biomarkers for early detection of its pathological features. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer membrane-enclosed nanoparticles of cellular origin, instrumental in facilitating various intercellular interactions through the transport and transfer of molecules between neighboring cells. EVs have come to light as important factors containing cargo that may alter/contribute to AD pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to compare the cargo composition of EVs isolated from neurons of people with AD to controls. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) were derived from patients with AD (n=8) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals (n=6), followed by differentiation into excitatory glutamatergic neurons. Subsequently, secreted EVs were isolated from these mature neurons, followed by the execution of bulk RNA sequencing. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the presence of various RNA biotypes within the EVs, notably highlighting a significant distinction in small nuclear RNAs (RNU) between EVs derived from AD versus CU. At adjusted p<0.05, 57 genes were differentially expressed between the EVs from AD and CL neurons. Visualization of the transcriptomic data showed significantly upregulated genes within EVs from AD neurons, associated with pathways related to neuronal maturation, epigenetic modifications, and mitochondrial functions. Our findings further substantiate the evidence that EV cargo from AD neurons exhibit alterations that may contribute to elucidate AD pathology and discovery of disease biomarkers.
