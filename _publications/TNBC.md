  As a subtype of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits unique pathological phenotypes and severe morbidity trends. Based on RNA sequencing data from 285 tumor tissues and 66 normal tissues of TNBC patients, we analyzed gene expression abnormalities, alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNBC, and explored their potential roles as biomarkers. Our study revealed significant differences in both gene expression and APA events between tumor and normal tissues of TNBC patients, with these genes predominantly involved in protein-related biological processes such as protein transcription, folding, localization, and targeting. Further apaQTL analysis indicated significant associations between APA events of specific genes and SNPs. Notably, we found that the APA event of the TMED9 gene is significantly influenced by SNP rs3749822, where the SNP substitution markedly increases the PolyA length of TMED9, subsequently affecting its mRNA's stability and expression level. This study elucidates the significant association between SNP rs3749822 and the APA event of the TMED9 gene, emphasizing the importance of APA events in protein synthesis and localization and highlighting the necessity of APA event analysis in cancer research. Our findings provide new directions for further exploration of SNPs affecting APA events, aiding in identifying disease-susceptible populations and improving prognostic methods.
